# NCI-CAFE-ARD
progress towards making the CSIRO CAFE archive more analysis ready for sustainable marine resources applications.

NB: project staff from the DCFP have aleready done a great deal of work making the reanalysis (RA) and hindcasts/forecasts much more analysis ready (AR) than their original `netcdf` file output.  Files are already converted to `zarr zip-store` collections on `/g/data/xv83/dcfp`.
